# Git is a Version Control System (VCS) a tool that helps us to keep track of differences in a file or collection of files over time. It can be used by different people who are working on the same 
project without using the same network. Github is the hosting platform used for the version control. Github is where developers store their projects and network with like minded people. It's use 
is not strictly for developers since the version control can be useful in other areas.
